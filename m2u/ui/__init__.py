""" m2u main UI module

This is responsible to create a PySide2 based common UI.

The UI-load-process is initialized by the Program module when requested
to generate the UI by the general initialize script
`program.ui.create_ui()`

There may exist Program or Editor specific UI parts which can be
integrated from the specific implementations when this module requests
them.

It may be necessary for the Program to do some pre-initialization steps
to allow a PySide2 based UI to run alongside. It may also generally be
necessary to attach the m2u-window to the Programs main window.
